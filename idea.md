Similar to Call Of Duty zombies, a game that allows a player to choose a map and play a round based zombies survival game.

- Zombie has a base 100 health points which increases every round (amount tbd)
- A player will spawn in a starting room on the map
- Damaging a zombie will award the player points

- Zombies will have spawn points outside the map that will then make their way into the map via windows or entraces
- Windows may have up to 6 boards place on them (by default all windows will have all boards)
- Zombies will need to remove all boards on a window before gaining access onto the map
- A mystery box will be avaiable at a random spot on the map that allows the player to spend points for a random weapon (better weapons available than can be purchased on a wall)
- Perk machines are placed around the map which give the player certain benefits
- Player can have up to 4 perks equipped at once
- Player has 100 health points
